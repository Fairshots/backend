        "Biography": "My name is Aaron Carback, I am a photographer from Baltimore Maryland. After returning from a pediatric physical therapy internship in South Africa, my passion for those in need has exploded. My faith in Jesus Christ fuels an internal drive to love the poor, weak, and fatherless. Through photography, and the appropriate platform to bring attention, education, and further humanitarian effort, I believe that I can change the world. I am looking for an aggressive NGO desperate to go to the ends of the world in order to serve those in need and tell \"Other\"s how they can help.",

Having been raised in the urban environment of Montreal, I had the privilege to grow up in a community who stood for human rights, woman rights and equality. However, as I started to work in developing countries and war zones I become more aware of the many cultural obstaclesâ€™ that prevent us from relating to the many social problems in those nations. As an artist my main purpose is to create art that help the suppressed communities and create a voice for them. Having worked in Haiti, Afganistan, South Tailand, Iraq, Iran, DRC and many more countries who struggle for liberty, I will risk it all to create narratives and stories in order to provide visibility for human right. My art finds strength and humanity in the most difficult places. I have built a none for profit (www.foundation64.org) that creates sustainable visuals for grass roots organization who support woman right and child protection. Therefore, better representing the powerful work they do. With all financial gained is directly deposited in the organizations account. In addition, with support and training, I will teach the locals to document them self. Creating powerful visuals is not enough, we need to find sustainable solutions. Supporting, education and giving the power to does who have lost it.",

Selections from Fight Night have been shown on the New York Times Lens blog, Burn Magazine, and in gallery exhibits in Des Moines, Minneapolis and New York. Brian began studying photography on a part-time basis as a creative outlet. Those classes quickly developed into a passion, but he did not know what he wanted to do. It was not until the first anniversary of hurricane Katrina that he found the direction. Always being a bit of an activist, Brian was angered that a year after the hurricane hit, a great city like New Orleans was still in ruins. After spending a week in New Orleans photographing the devastation and talking to the residents, he found that telling stories with the camera was what he needed to do.",

I then immersed myself in my local punk scene, taking photos of bandsâ€” something that has taken me around the world many times over and has lead to my work being published anywhere from Playboy to AOL. At the same time, I received a BA in Art/ Photography from Millersville University and an MFA in documentary photography from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Following grad school I moved back to the East Coast and continued working in photojournalism and portraiture for folks like The Travel Channel, Brooklyn Vegan, and NPR. For the past 8 years in Virginia I've been teaching photography at Thomas Nelson Community College & Christopher Newport University.",

After exhibiting my first documentary reportages in the early nineties, Iâ€™ve turned to the aid agencies and have spent twenty years working in humanitarian emergency and development with several international organisations worldwide.\nIn early 2013, I left the ordinary offices to devote my professional career again fully to photography. I am keeping my photographic work close to people, their destinies, hence my reportages portray peculiarities of an often deprived civil society affected by latent or bygone conflict.\nI have since been working on several projects such as Frozen Conflicts in the Caucasus depicting the ordinary people whose life is in limbo following the conflicts of the nineties and Palestinian Chronicles as a continuation of the series taken in early nineties, focusing on the daily realities of the numerous refugee camps' population. Recently, I am working on subjects depicting hard labour and seasonal migration flows in the overpopulated Bengal bay and documenting statelessness of Bihari and Rohingya.Â",

I discovered photography at the age of 13, when I fell in love with the works of Magnum photographers, while being inspired at the same time by young emerging artists. My photographic universe is filled both with fantasy and realism â€“ I have an eye to witness the seen and one to perceive the unseen. My work is the result of my love for people and nature and the peculiarities of daily life. Available for commissions around the world.",

Over the past three years she has covered the compelling criminal case of Ms. Stacey Hyde, who was acquitted and released in May 2015 with the help of Justice for Woman, a campaigning organisation whom SchÃ¶nstÃ¤dt partnered with on the case. In 2012, SchÃ¶nstÃ¤dt and her partners founded â€œThe 16 Bars Projectâ€, a multi-media collaborative project working with the aim to raise awareness of the penal system through the medium of art. In 2014, her persistence to gain access to the German prison system and subsequent body of work was recognized with an award from The Guardian. At the centre of her work stands always the â€˜human elementâ€™. SchÃ¶nstÃ¤dt seeks out stories on people who have faced challenges and indeed are challenged by life itself. Through her photographic and video works, the thread of an anthropological line is deeply woven. ---- Besides my London based commercial photography I am passionate for travel and social projects. I love to meet people and learn about their life and their culture.",

After the graduation, I worked for Garmin as a cartographer, and it is there that I became interested in travelling and photography. I later moved to California, where I now run my photography business, and also teach Natural Sciences at a Russian Heritage school. I live in San Jose with my boyfriend, Genaro, who makes the most delicious tacos in the world, and who makes me really happy every day. Photographing nature and people constantly reminds me that the Universe is on our side, the world is alive and breathing, and nature is worth fighting for. I love people and I love meeting cultures and I love immersing myself into their ways of life. And if I can capture these situations on a camera and show the rest of the world, itâ€™s opening their eyes. We live in such a fairytale kind of environment. For us to see what such a huge percentage of the world is living in or coping with â€“ I think we need to see it. And hopefully it triggers that want in us to help.",

After school, I went to university gaining a BA Hons degrees in Cultural Studies, which in turn led to my fascination with peopleâ€™s unique stories, where they came from, how it had shaped them and where they may be headed. About that same time, Iâ€™d started to develop a keen interest in photography, so it seemed obvious that this would work as a fine medium to try to capture, in a singular moment, some aspect, some fragment of these peoples lives.",

In Paris, I worked with a notable list of diverse clients including Elite, Ford, Viva, Women, and Karin & Silent model agencies. During my time living in China I worked for prestigious publications such as Vogue China, Lâ€™Officiel, Madame Figaro, Milk Magazine, Ilook magazine, Modern Weekly and many more. I also cooperated on various advertisement campaigns for Hilton Hotels, Martell Cognac, and Elite World and China model competitions. As a result, I have extensive knowledge and confidence in navigating the ins-and-outs of the photographic medium and industry. My expertise in the photography industry extends beyond my work as a professional photographer. In 2012, following my relocation to Bangkok, I co-founded an online photography and lifestyle magazine called www.aserica.com. This project has allowed me to expand my skills in coordinating photo-shoots, conducting image research, developing visual identities, as well as approaching ideas using diverse and innovative editorial angles both in lifestyle and fashion. In addition, I co-founded and curated an online contemporary gallery named Weissprint (www.weissprint.com), providing me with new skills in managing photographers and selling their work. It should also be noted that I have lived in the Asia-Pacific region for more than 15 years in culturally vibrant cities including Hanoi, Shanghai, Beijing, Sydney, and Bangkok. These precious years have provided me with very intimate insights into the region and its people, allowing me to develop nuanced communication skills and a taste for exploration.",

        "Biography": "I'm a novice photographer, but I'm driven by boundless curiosity to capture stories that are both artful and significant. Best described as documentary photography, my style favours the candid public scene, while both urban and natural settings form the backdrop to the personal, human narratives at the core of my work. Compositional experimentation and a knack for timing (or just plain luck) are my most indispensable photographic tools, and my favourite images are unstaged and spontaneous - ones that record moments of coincidental clarity or meaningful chance amidst the chaos of everyday human activity.",

Growing up there allowed me to witness the worst and the best of our species.\n\nI have travelled extensively to understand the illusions that entrap, limit and at the same time define us as early 21st century humans, and hopefully my work  portraits a little bit of that. I have to admit I am a little bit embarrassed about being human but I am also hopeful: I am one of those romantic people who still believes in mankind. I believe that we can redeem ourselves, and start living with respect and dignity regardless of race, nationality or any \"Other\" imposed separation.\n\nMy mission is to help us achieve emancipation by changing the way people see the world and their relationship with \"Other\"s. Photography just happened to be they way I chose to achieve that.  Although I pay my bills with commercial photography & videography work, my true passion is in social documentary and at the moment I am working on transitioning to being a full time social documentarist.\n\nI am also very grateful to be alive in such decisive times and I love meeting and working with people and organizations that are also working towards the same goals. So if what I said resonates with your own mission please do get in touch.",

It's always fascinating for me, to walk the streets with my camera trying to find order and balance in a seeming chaos . Cities are my playground, where humans are the center of my work. The most challenging part is trying to find greatness in ordinary thing and daily life. Beauty and harmony are everywhere, and it's up to the photographer to snap the photograph at the right moment . Day after day, my vision is evolving on my society, photography brought me a more human contact with people and strangers that I wouldn't have known without photography. There's in every street's corner a story to be told and an encouter to be done .",

I love the spontaneity of the diverse world we live in, where belonging is everywhere. I have a strong belief that story is in everything, and we can make a difference with our creativity. I often say it's the David Attenborough approach, share the magic of humanity in hope it will inspire us to preserve nature and all life. My Nonna (Grandm\"Other\") came from Calabria, Italy to Melbourne after the War WW2 for a better life. She lived, loved and worked in a foreign land with her husband and ten children to build a future. From this I learned the value of simplicity and it is my aim to always find the simple solutions in work and life. No matter how the channels change, emotive storytelling will always be at the core of my purpose.' Serena Stevenson",

        "Biography": "While attending university in Illinois, I began to pursue a degree in Photojournalism. In my third year, I had to ask my parents for financial help. My father agreed to help only if I majored in business. I have my BS degree in Statistical Economics. I spent the last 23 years in the corporate area of medical device technology performing mergers & acquisitions for some of the largest players in that space. I have lived in 6 different countries in North America, Europe, and Asia and have gained a broad, global appreciation for the state of healthcare, and also humanity across the globe. Last year, I came across a website called, \"When To Jump\". It encourages one to follow their passion. I did. I jumped out of the corporate world and I am pursuing my dream of photojournalism with a focus on humanitarian issues and causes. All of my work thus far, as I build my business portfolio, has been pro-bono. I have just started to charge for services feeling pretty good about the quality of the portfolio I've built.",

        "Biography": "I am a 23 year old Nigerian Photographer and for the longest time Photography has been the medium through which I am able to express myself. Being an introvert plus an only child I grew up speaking very little words, but with my Camera and Photos I have gotten the push to interact with those around me more than I was used to. My preferred style of Photography is documentary Photography simply because of it's authenticity, no plans or alterations are made and what you see is basically what you get. I love to travel to places I wouldnâ€™t normally go, interact with the locals, learn new things about them and explore new places which is a good way to expand my knowledge and exposure. I make it a point to note the importance of understanding your subject because I believe if there is no communication and understanding between the Camera, the subject and the Photographer then the Photo as a finished product of your interaction will not communicate the accurate emotions to itâ€™s viewer (s). This is interpreted in my Photographs as I hope youâ€™ll see in my work. Being able to see, experience and document the various realities of different human beings spread out across villages, towns, cities, countries and continents is what motivates me to keep pushing and doing what I know how to do best, Photography.",
